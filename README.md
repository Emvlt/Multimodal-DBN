# Multimodal-DBN
This repository holds an implementation of functions that can perform multimodal learning. They are coded in the .py files
It is comes with a demoon two parts on how to use them. The first part is Training_DBN.ipynb and the second part is Fine_tuning.ipynb.

So far, 
  - it works with up to two modalities but it is designed to deal with more.
  - it works on a machine that has two GPUs but is designed to be "device-agnostic"
